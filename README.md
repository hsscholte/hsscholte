# About me.
- âš¡ I live with my daughter (2011) and cat (2004) in middle of Amsterdam. We have a large terrace (see third point).
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently most interested, although I work on many things, on linking developmental neuroscience / psychology to training DNNs to align DNNs better with human behaviour. 
- ðŸ”­ One of the moments I am at my happiest is when I can read a book when it is warm and I can sit outside in the shadow (see first point).
